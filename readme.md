# Sumzy Microservices

This repo contains the services for Sumzy, in a microservice architecture. To learn more about Sumzy, check out the main [readme](https://github.com/jackson-lewis/sumzy#readme).

I've dabbled previously in both AWS and GCP, using services such as EC2, Lambda, and S3. Sumzy encompasses a full architecture on AWS to full support a microservice architecture.

The complete list of AWS services used:
